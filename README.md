# Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects and lab exercises completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** program. These artifacts demonstrate hands-on experience with incident response, risk analysis, access control, compliance frameworks, and basic scripting ‚Äî all aligned with cybersecurity best practices.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Descriptions

- **Incident Handlers Journal**  
  A journal documenting incident response activities, including identification, containment, eradication, and recovery steps. Reflects an understanding of real-world incident response workflows.

- **Algorithm for File Updates in Python**  
  A custom Python script designed to manage and automate updates to sensitive files. Demonstrates basic automation skills, file handling, and logic used in security tooling.

- **Controls and Compliance Checklist**  
  A checklist aligning cybersecurity controls to compliance requirements. Demonstrates knowledge of regulatory frameworks and implementation of control mapping.

- **PASTA Worksheet**  
  A threat modeling document based on the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework. Highlights risk evaluation and threat scenario development.

- **Access and Control Worksheet**  
  Exercises related to implementing and analyzing access control models, including role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles.

- **Applying Filters to SQL Queries**  
  A lab applying SQL filtering techniques for investigating data in security databases. Demonstrates basic data querying and analysis relevant to threat detection.

- **Risk Register**  
  A structured log of identified risks, their potential impacts, and mitigation strategies. Reflects risk management and governance practices.

- **Data Leak Worksheet**  
  A case-based exercise analyzing the source and implications of a data breach. Emphasizes detection, response strategy, and prevention recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Threat modeling (PASTA)
- Incident response documentation
